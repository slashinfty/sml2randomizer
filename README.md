# sml2randomizer

A randomizer for Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins.

Originally written in Java and released in 2017. Rewritten in JavaScript in 2018.

In order to play, you need a ROM of SML2 (either v1.0 or v1.2) and a way to play (emulator or EverDrive).

All research that was done in creating this randomizer has been saved and can be found in the research folder (WIP).

Source code for the randomizer can be found in the [sml2r-node](https://github.com/slashinfty/sml2r-node) NPM package.
