        <p>Created initially at the end of 2016 and beginning of 2017 by dadinfinitum (formerly known as slashinfty) as an excuse to learn more Java. Used what information was available online thanks to ROM hackers SmellyMoo and Raccoon Sam. Eventually it was too annoying to keep updating the interface for the Java application, and getting people to use the most up-to-date version was tedious, so as an excuse to learn JavaScript (and HTML and CSS), it was ported to a browser-based randomizer at the start of 2018. More and more features have been integrated since the start thanks to another ROM hacker named toruzz, who has created the DX enhancement for SML2.</p>

        <div class="card-body">
        <p>Below is a detailed list of what is possible to be changed in the randomizer in each and every setting. If you are savvy with JavaScript, you can explore the source code.</p>
        </div>
        <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
            <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-dark"><p>
            All levels are randomized within sets (all levels with two exits within their own set and all boss levels within their own set).<br>To ensure completion, Turtle Zone Special can not be in Mushroom House's overworld location.
            </p></li>
            <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-dark"><p>
            All levels with two exits (Tree Zone 2, Hippo, Space Zone 1, Macro Zone 1, Pumpkin Zone 2, Pumpkin Zone 3, and Turtle Zone 2) can have their exits swapped.<br>If all dual exit levels have their exits swapped, Hippo will not be swapped (as the top exit is more difficult to get to and more desirable) and whichever level is in Macro Zone 1's overworld location will not be swapped (to make the secret exit more desirable); if Hippo is in Macro Zone 1's overworld location, then it is swapped.
            </p></li>
            <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-dark"><p>
            Bosses in boss levels, independent of boss level location, can be randomized.<br>Boss health can be randomized (in increments of 2: each pig can have 4 to 8 health, tatanga, witch, and each Wario phase can have 6 to 10 health, and bird, octopus, and rat can have 6 to 12 health - fireballs do 1 damage, jumps do 2 damage).
            </p></li>
            <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-dark"><p>
            Enemies within each level are randomized, with some exceptions.<br>Most notably, enemies that interact with the background, such as bullet bills, can not have other enemies in their original location (but sometimes they can be in other locations).<br>Piranha Plants and Fire Piranha Plants are swapped in every level they appear for the exception of Pumpkin Zone 2, Pumpkin Zone 4, and Macro Zone 3, due to graphical oddities.
            </p></li>
            <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-dark"><p>
            All standalone power-ups are randomized, except for Moneybags in Tree Zone 1 (their sprite ID matches an enemy in the level).<br>All question mark power-up blocks are randomized.<br>Power-ups in the Wario fight are randomized, and if using a DX ROM, a heart is a possibility.<br>Bonus bell game power-ups are randomized.<br>If doing one-hit knockout mode, all hearts and stars are removed.
            </p></li>
            <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-dark"><p>
            Platforms in Tree Zone 4, Tree Zone 5, and Wario's Castle have been randomized, including the height of some platforms in Wario's Castle.
            </p></li>
            <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-dark"><p>
            Music on the file select screen, overworld, in zones, and in each level has been randomized.<br>Music in levels can be sped up to match "hurry up" music (when there are under 100 seconds left on the timer).
            </p></li>
            <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-dark"><p>
            Gravity has been randomized, so that levels can have either normal, moon, or space gravity (no matter what their original gravity was).<br>To ensure completion, gravity can not be changed in Pumpkin Zone 2 or Macro Zone 2, and Pumpkin Zone 3 can not have moon gravity.
            </p></li>
            <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-dark"><p>
            Physics can be randomized, with Luigi and ice as options (if using a DX ROM, it will force you to play as Mario or Luigi in some levels).
            </p></li>
            <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-dark"><p>
            Some levels can randomly become autoscrollers, and autoscrollers can be turned off.<br>To ensure completion, if Space Zone 1 has moon gravity it can not be an autoscroller, and if Space Zone 1 is an autoscroller then the midway bell is removed.<br>Some levels can have autoscrollers with the screen scrolling at double speed.<br>To ensure completion, if Hippo has moon gravity or if Mario Zone 3 is in Mushroom House's overworld location, neither of them can have fast autoscrollers.
            </p></li>
            <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-dark"><p>
            Gambling costs on the overworld have been randomized and the graphics display question marks for the costs to the player.<br>The cost for the first pipe is between 20 and 125, the second pipe is between 100 and 350, the third pipe is between 250 and 600, and the final pipe is between 550 and 999 (all pipes are guaranteed to increase in cost).<br>If doing one-hit knockout mode, all costs will be 999.
            </p></li>
            <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-dark"><p>
            One-hit knockout mode will disable soft resetting with Start+Select+A+B and exiting levels with Start+Select, plus start the player with zero additional lives, remove all hearts and stars from the game, and make all gambling costs equal to 999.
            </p></li>
            <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-dark"><p>
            Credits are altered to have random facts provided by dadinfinitum and oh_deer and lyrics by iceplug.<br>The file select screen includes the seed number and flags, primarily for racing purposes.
            </p></li>
